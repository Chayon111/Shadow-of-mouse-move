# Shadow-of-mouse-move
This is a Shadow of mouse move practice by JavaScript. When you move your mouse this text shadow change position as your mouse movement. You can also edit this text and write here as your wish. In summary, the code creates an eye-catching display where the text shadow of the "❤ LOVE ❣" text changes dynamically as the user moves the mouse.
